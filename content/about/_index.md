We are a one-man company (_not a legal entity_) based in humble New Zealand with a mission to create great change in technology. Most startups build products based on trends and popularity and follow the "fail fast, fail often" mentality. We do not have that opinion or that luxury.

The goal has never been to be a unicorn, or to pivot until we find something that sticks. The goal has always been to build modern computing systems that can last the test of time. This is highly ambitious, this is higly unknown but we have a belief and a vision and this is what we will execute.
